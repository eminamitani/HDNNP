| This program is an implementation of HDNNP that is
  suggested by Behler *et al* [Ref]_.
| HDNNP stands for **High Dimensional Neural Network Potential**.
| HDNNP is one of machine learning potentials that is used to
  reduce calculation cost of DFT(Density Functional Theory) calculation.

| Currently, energy and force prediction using symmetry function have been implemented.
